# Decision making with Matrices

# This is a pretty simple assingment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations.

# The problem is: you and your work firends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a resturant thats best for everyone.  
# Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so eveyone is happier.

# Displicte the simplictiy of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.

# This process was thoughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approah can prove helpful on any number of 
# decsion making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.

# You asked your 10 work friends to answer a survey. They gave you back the following dictionary object.


#to determine random values for weights

# The most imporant idea in this project is the idea of a linear combination.

# Informally describe what a linear combination is and how it will relate to our resturant matrix.

    #This is for you to answer! However....https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination
    # essentially you are multiplying each term by a constant and summing the results.

# Choose a person and compute(using a linear combination) the top restaurant for them.  
# What does each entry in the resulting vector represent?
